# Development Roadmap

## How to Use This Roadmap
1. Main items (marked with "- [ ]") represent broad development goals and should remain unchecked
2. Create sub-items under each main item to track specific implementations and progress
3. Only check off sub-items as they are completed
4. Add new sub-items as needed to better document what was actually implemented

Example:
```markdown
- [ ] Create Layout system for consistent page structure
    - [x] Implemented base PageLayout component with header and footer
    - [x] Added responsive container system
    - [ ] Created admin layout wrapper
```
