# Application Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Structure
```
components/
├── ui/          # Base UI components
├── layout/      # Layout components
├── forms/       # Form-related components
└── admin/       # Admin interface components
```

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger component events
2. Events are handled by component logic
3. API calls are made when necessary
4. State is updated accordingly
5. Components re-render with new data

### State Management
- Local component state for UI-specific data
- React Router for URL-based state
- (Future) Global state management if needed

### Routing Structure
- `/` - Main question submission page
- `/admin` - Admin routes
  - `/admin/login`
  - `/admin/dashboard`
  - `/admin/review`
  - `/admin/knowledge-base`

## Future Backend Architecture

### API Structure
```
api/
├── routes/      # API route handlers
├── models/      # Data models
├── services/    # Business logic
└── middleware/  # Request middleware
```

### Database Schema (Planned)
```
Questions
- id: UUID
- content: Text
- status: Enum
- created_at: Timestamp
- updated_at: Timestamp

Users
- id: UUID
- email: String
- name: String
- role: Enum

Answers
- id: UUID
- question_id: UUID
- content: Text
- created_at: Timestamp
```

### Security Considerations
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- CORS configuration
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
